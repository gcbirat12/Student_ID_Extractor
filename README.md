# Student_ID_Extractor

I was faced with a challenge where I had arouns 1000 PDF pages with student ELA and Math state scores and all of them were mixed up into one pdf. In this code, I have converetd the PDF into a JPEG file and extracted the Student ID and placed them into their respective STUDENT ID folder.
